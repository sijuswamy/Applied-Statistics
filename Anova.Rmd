## Objective of the lesson

In class we handed out ``Examples of ANOVA". Below we redo the example using R.

1. **Set up an analysis of variance test for the following data showing yields from three fertilizers- F1, F2, and F3.**

F1: 18.2, 20.1, 17.6, 16.8, 18.8, 19.7, 19.1

F2: 17.4, 18.7, 19.1, 16.4, 15.9, 18.4, 17.7

F3: 15.2, 18.8, 17.7, 16.5, 15.9, 17.1, 16.7

There are three groups with seven observations per group. We denote group $i$ values by $yi$:

```{r}
 y1 = c(18.2, 20.1, 17.6, 16.8, 18.8, 19.7, 19.1)
 y2 = c(17.4, 18.7, 19.1, 16.4, 15.9, 18.4, 17.7)
 y3 = c(15.2, 18.8, 17.7, 16.5, 15.9, 17.1, 16.7)
```

Now we combine them into one long vector, with a second vector, group, identifying group
membership:
```{r}
y = c(y1, y2, y3)
n = rep(7, 3)
Fertilizer = rep(1:3, n)
```

Now we show summary statistics by group and overall. We locally define a temporary
function, `tmpfn`, to make this easier.



```{r}
 tmpfn = function(x) c(sum = sum(x), mean = mean(x), var = var(x), n = length(x))
```


```{r}
tapply(y, Fertilizer, tmpfn)
```

While we could show you how to use R to mimic the computation of SS by hand, it is
more natural to go directly to the ANOVA table.

```{r}
data = data.frame(y_values = y, Fertilizer = factor(Fertilizer))
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(data, format="markdown")
```
## Displaying the dataframe in a better format

```{r}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(data,                 # Export txt
          summary = FALSE,
          type = "text",
          out = "data_stargazer_txt.txt")
```
```{r}

par(mar=c(8, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1))

#create boxplots
boxplot(y_values ~ Fertilizer,
data = data,
main = "Yield in metric tonnes",
xlab = "Fertilizer",
ylab = "yield",
col = "steelblue",
border = "black", 
las = 2 #make x-axis labels perpendicular
)
```


```{r}
my_anova=aov(y ~ Fertilizer, data)
summary(my_anova)
```

## Perform Post-Hoc Tests (If Necessary)

If the p-value in the ANOVA output is less than .05, we reject the null hypothesis. This tells us that the mean value between each group is not equal. However, it doesnâ€™t tell us which groups differ from each other.

In order to find this out, we must perform a post hoc test. In R, we can use the `TukeyHSD()` function to do so:

```{r}
TukeyHSD(my_anova)
```

So it is reasonable to think that the difference between Fertilizer 1 and 3 is significant at 5% level.


2. **Set up an analysis of variance table for the following per acre production data for three varities of wheat, each grown on 4 plots and state if the variety differences are significant.**

V1: 6 7 3 8

V2: 5 5 3 7

V3: 5 4 3 4


## Two-way anova using R


1. **Set up analysis of variance table for the following two-way design results.**


```{r}
dw <- read.table(header=T, text='
 Fertilizer A  B C 
   W   6    5     5   
   X   7    5     4   
   Y   3    3     3  
   Z   8    7     4  
 ')
dw
```

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
data=dw %>% 
  gather(v, yield, A:C) %>% 
  separate(v, c("seed")) %>% 
  arrange(Fertilizer)
```

```{r}
data
```

```{r}
table(data$Fertilizer, data$seed)
```

## Exploring the Data

Before we even fit the two-way ANOVA model, we can gain a better understanding of the data by finding the mean and standard deviation of weight loss for each of the six treatment groups using the dplyr package:


```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(Fertilizer) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(yield),
            sd = sd(yield))

```


## Visualization

We can also create a boxplot for each of the six treatment groups to visualize the distribution of weight loss for each group:

```{r}
par(mar=c(8, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1))

#create boxplots
boxplot(yield ~ Fertilizer,
data = data,
main = "Yield in metric tonnes",
xlab = "Fertilizer",
ylab = "Seed",
col = "steelblue",
border = "black", 
las = 2 #make x-axis labels perpendicular
)
```

## Anova


```{r}
model = aov(yield~Fertilizer*seed, data = data)
#view the model output
summary(model)
```
