## Syllabus

**Experiment 1: Visualization of data** 
Tables, charts and plots. Visualising Measures of Central Tendency, Variation, and 
Shape. Box plots, Pareto diagrams. How to find the mean, median, standard deviation 
and quantiles of a set of observations.

Students may experiment with real as well as artificial data sets.

**Experiment 2: Probability Distributions**
Set operations, simulation of various properties. Baysâ€™ rule. Generate and Visualize 
Discrete and continuous distributions using the statistical environment. Demonstration 
of CDF and PDF uniform and normal, binomial Poisson distributions. Students are 
expected to generate artificial data using the chosen statistical environment and explore 
various distribution and its properties. Various parameter changes may be studied.

**Experiment 3:Random samples**
How to generate random numbers. Study how to select a random sample with 
replacement from normal and uniform distribution. Students can use the built in 
functions to explore random sample selection.

**Experiment 4: Study of binomial distribution** Plots of density and distribution functions. Normal 
approximation to the Binomial distribution. Central limit theorem.

**Experiment 5: Study of confidence intervals** How to compute confidence intervals for the mean when 
the standard deviation is known.

**Experiment 6:How to perform tests of hypotheses about the mean when the variance is known**
How to compute the p-value. Explore the connection between the critical region, the 
test statistic, and the p-value.

**Experiment 7: How to find quantiles of the t-distribution** How to perform a significance test for 
testing the mean of a population with unknown standard deviation.

**Experiment 8: Compare populations means from two Normal distributions with unknown variance** Tests of Hypotheses for One Proportion
Tests of Hypotheses for Comparing Two Proportions.

**Experiment 9: Correlation Analysis** How to calculate the correlation between two variables. How to make scatter plots. 
Use the scatterplot to investigate the relationship between two variables.

**Experiment 10: Regression Analysis** Find the least-squares regression line. How to calculate and plot the residuals.

> Note 1: This laboratory is to be conducted with a suitable statistical software. The colleges 
can choose the statistical software. Some of the suggested environments are R, SciPy, SPSS 
Excel, or any other statistical analysis software depending on availability.

>Note 2: The students are expected to write code for statistical applications using the chosen 
environment. The instructor may choose a standard data set and ask the students to work 
with it.
